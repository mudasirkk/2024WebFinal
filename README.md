# Intro to Web Programming

**Mudasir Khan**

I am a computer science major at SUNY New Paltz. I like to play video games in my spare time as well as go out in nature. I also enjoy fishing, hiking, and horseback riding.

In terms of my computer experience, I am a computer science major, and I have taken the Computer Science 1-3 classes, as well as Web Development 1 and 2, and Software Practices. I have collaborated on a number of projects, specifically in my web development courses. I created a shop-like page where the user was able to select items and add them to a cart. I also collaborated with IBM to create a positivity jar application that took as input user-created “positivity statements” and released them at a given time as a compilation of all the positive statements.

In today’s world, with the internet so easily accessible, it is important to understand how web programming works and to be able to create basic webpages and applications yourself. This skill will allow a person to advertise themselves if they have any future businesses, as well as giving them an opportunity to sell this skill as a service to the ever-growing market of internet users.
